======

This is a small example of an MPI+OmpSs application running optionally with DLB.

Compilation
-----------
Check the Makefile paths are correct and run `make`. The Makefile assumes you have
Mercurium drivers in your PATH.

Execution
---------
Ideally, executing 'run.sh' script should be enough. Though, depending on your MPI
implementation, you may need to add or modify some specific mpirun flags for either
set the LD_PRELOAD variable or to correctly set the binding for all processes. Note
that DLB will fail if some process share CPU ownership with another one.

You can change the values of DLB and TRACE variables to modify the script behaviour.
By default both options are set to 0, which means that the example program will run
without DLB nor tracing capabilities. Setting DLB to 1 should enable DLB to perform
some basic balancing techniques. And setting TRACE to 1 will enable the tracing
through the EXTRAE tracing library. The TRACE options assumes that you have EXTRAE
correctly installed, and your environment variable EXTRAE_HOME points to that path.
This option will generate a tracefile.prv which can be opened using the PARAVER
application.
